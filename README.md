# ChordTuneFollower
ChordTuneFollower aims to provide a way to follow chords and tabs of many songs according to the input received through the microphone of the device the program is run on:

#### Important :  This is a personal project, for personal use and somehow it's like a challenge to myself
    - If you somehow ended up reviewing this project and you are a novice like myself I hope you read the code and learn some things with it, if you wanted to make any contributions or any other thing, please feel free to contact me through my email.

#### Primary goals (TO-DO)
- Make the GUI using GNOME and Libadwaita look and feeling (for the desktop app)
- Introduce the logic for interpreting the chord from the microphone using a Python tool or building up one by myself

##### If this project goes well I might...
- Port it to a mobile application UI, maybe for Android using MaterialUI, mainly aiming for use for Android 9+, otherwise Libadwaita gives the flexibility for a mobile like experience using a highly adaptable UI, sadly only available for desktops and Linux mobile devices using Phosh
